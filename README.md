# X Reply Search Chrome Extension

## Overview
X Reply Search is a Chrome browser extension that makes it easy to search replies to specific X posts using keywords. By leveraging X's `conversation_id` search syntax, this tool allows users to quickly find relevant replies without manually constructing search queries.

For example, if you're on a post like `https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1895582321136583162` and want to find replies containing "Tesla," the extension generates the search query `conversation_id:1895582321136583162 Tesla` and opens the results in a new tab.

## Features
- **Automatic Post Detection**: Extracts the post ID from the current X page URL.
- **Keyword Search**: Enter any keyword to search within replies.
- **Flexible Input**: Trigger searches by clicking the "Search Replies" button or pressing Enter.
- **Instant Focus**: The keyword input field is automatically selected when opening the extension.
- **Simple Interface**: Clean, user-friendly popup design.
